# HoriseonRefactor
Refactoring existing webpage to make it more accessible.

## Description 

For this page, I was tasked to take the initial index.html and style.css and refactor it to meet accessibility standareds.  

Some items that needed to be changed were the initial Div elements to be changed to semantic elements (header, section, article, footer).

I also consolidated duplicate style entries for certain classes.  This made the code look more uniform and flow with the layout of the page.

I had a great time working on this project. My goal is to always be improving and would love any and all feedback on what I have missed or ways I could have done this better.
